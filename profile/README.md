## Hi there 👋

This initiative arose because of prolonged inactivity of the @FriendsOfGalaxy account, which used to manage and maintain unofficial integrations for GOG GALAXY 2.0. 

## Goals
- Secure plugins maintained by @FriendsOfGalaxy: Steam, Ubisoft, Origin, ...
    - Review and merge community fixes to avoid stuck pull requests like this one: https://github.com/FriendsOfGalaxy/galaxy-integration-uplay/pull/34
- Be a source of a secure plugin collection for GOG GALAXY
    - So that the @GOG team can use it for auto-updating plugins instead of relying on a list provided by the @FriendsOfGalaxy account

## To achieve those goals we plan to:
1. Clone plugins that were maintained by FriendsOfGalaxy (without plugins maintained by external developers)
2. Reuse the FriendsOfGalaxy auto-updating system for externally maintained plugins to synchronize them periodically and review changes for security reasons
3. Set up secure organization rules so that any change in plugins can be done only with the approval of a few trusted developers
4. Convince GOG to switch their sources from the dead FriendsOfGalaxy account to this organization*

\* If the last step fails, we will create our own plugins updater.

## Non-goals (for now):
- Taking care of abandoned plugins
- Fixing issues and providing new features for popular plugins
- Create and improve useful tools and be a knowledge base for plugin developers
